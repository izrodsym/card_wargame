# card_wargame
War is played with a deck of 52 cards. The game is played by two players. Each player has 26 cards from the entire deck.

The game is played as follows:

Each of the two players shows a card. The two cards shown are compared in strength and the player with the stronger card collects both cards. Cards are stored in a separate array. If the cards are of equal strength (regardless of suit), each player must bet three new cards in that order. The third of the new cards is compared to the corresponding third card of the other player. The winner collects all the cards that are shown (in this case 8 cards in total). If the third cards are again equal in strength, the players draw one card each and compare it until there is a difference in strength. Winner takes all cards that are shown.

After the players have turned over all 26 cards, the winner is determined by which player has won the most cards.
